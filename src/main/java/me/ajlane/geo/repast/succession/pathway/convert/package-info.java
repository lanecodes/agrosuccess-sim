/**
 * Convert between different representations of succession pathways
 *
 * <p>
 * Succession pathways can be expressed in terms of either numerical codes or natural languages
 * aliases. This is to enable modellers to represent succession processes in terms they understand
 * (natural language) and automatically covert this information into numerical data that can be
 * easily and efficiently manipulated in a simulation model. Classes in this package are used to
 * convert between the two representations.
