/**
 * <p>
 * Represents the way water flows over a raster grid by representing each catchment in the landscape
 * using a simple directed tree-like graph.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Catchments are discovered during construction and used to create {@link JgraphtCatchmentFlow}
 * instances for each of the outlets in the provided flow direction map. We use
 * {@link org.jgrapht.Graph} objects to store and manipulate the graphs. This is because the
 * <a href="https://jgrapht.org/">JGraphT</a> project provide well-tested graph traversal algorithms
 * for these objects which we require and prefer to avoid re-implementing ourselves. We store
 * {@link GridLoc} objects in these graphs and note that they satisfy the
 * <a href="https://jgrapht.org/guide/VertexAndEdgeTypes#equals-and-hashcode">requirements</a>
 * necessary for them to be used as graph keys in a {@code org.jgrapht.Graph}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Our reasons for not using the network implementation in Repast Simphony for this purpose are as
 * follows. The design of Repast network API E.g. in North et al. 2013 the network is used by agents
 * to modify their behaviour in response to changes in the state of their neighbours within their
 * local vicinity in the network. In contrast our use case in the analysis of the flow direction
 * network requires us to analyse the overall structure of the network, in particular using breadth
 * first search which is implemented in JGraphT but not Repast Simphony. We store {@link GridLoc}
 * objects in the graph, rather than decision-making agents as networks in Repast Simphony are
 * designed to represent the relationships between. We are using the graph data structure as an
 * artifact of the implementation/programming domain (i.e. a means to an end) rather than to
 * represent an important aspect of the application domain.

 * <ul>
 * <li>Refactor {@link #buildFlowSourceNetworkFromFlowDirectionMap()} and
 * {@link #separateCatchments(Set, Graph)} to improve performance. Profiling shows that when
 * building a {@link JgraphtLandscapeFlow} 92% of execution time is spent in
 * org.jgrapht.graph.AsSubgraph.initialize (java.util.Set, java.util.Set). Consider just building
 * separate trees by working backwards from the outlets.</li>
 * <li>Refactor validation code to an optional JgraphtLandscapeFlowValidator object with a
 * JgraphtLandscapeFlowValidator#validate method.</li>
