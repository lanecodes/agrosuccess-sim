# Rosalind scripts

These are scripts which should be modified and used to run AgroSuccess on
Roaslind--the King's HPC cluster.

The Repast Simphony model output files include scripts to run models on the PBS
scheduler but not Slurm. In response to discussion on the Repast Simhpny
mailing list in Feb 2020, Nick Collier [circulated these
scripts](https://sourceforge.net/p/repast/mailman/message/36926101/) to help
users run RS models on Slurm.

See [slurm-in-docker Github repo](https://github.com/SciDAS/slurm-in-docker)
for ideas on how to test running on Slurm without needing access to the
cluster.
